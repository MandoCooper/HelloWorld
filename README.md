# A little insight about MandoCooper
Hi everyone! My name is Armando Melgoza and currently work in Real Estate as a Financial Analyst for a Co-working company... kinda like WeWork, but waaaay more conservative. This README will give you a bit of information about me. 

## My Career Passions
I really love working in Tech. Specifically, I love working with a team on something new from start to finish. Project Management is very fulfilling but I really enjoy taking a direct role in the design process. However, what I really want to do is learn and understand everything that comes after... so the development side of things. 

## My Hobbies
I really enjoy sketching wireframes onto gridded paper and I don't know when that started being a thing for me. Other hobbies of mine are soccer, basketball, gym, boxing, and beach body surfing.
